## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Christopher CortÃ©s, a software developer @ Brigham Young University - Idaho. I like learning programming languages and building new software to make life easier. I would like to travel the world and learn how people in their culture make use of technology.

Python was my first programming language. I learned the syntax quite well and had a lot of fun writing programs with Python. Later, I learned JavaScript, Java, C#, and Kotlin. These programming languages helped me understand better the programming logic which has made a lot of sense now.

I have recently developed an Android application using Kotlin in Android Studio. It was fun but challenging. However, I love challenges. I want to learn more about Mobile applications and develop a sophisticated one of my own.
